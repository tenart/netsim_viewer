# netsim_viewer

This project is a Network Simulator with multiple different examples you can view. It is a great teaching tool for learning more about how networks function and how data is transmitted over a network. The examples have animations and information included in them to help simulate what is happening on a real network to help viewers visualize and understand networking.
